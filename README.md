# recordbot
Simple tool (with an awful name) for parsing apart a batch JSON export of records from the [GeoBlacklightMetadata](https://github.com/sgbalogh/omeka_GeoBlacklightMetadata) Omeka plugin.

By default, the script will place single records within a file structure that mimics the UURI passed to it in the record.
